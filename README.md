# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew. In this project, we analyze the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.
