# Internship CodSoft Project

Welcome to the Internship CodSoft project! This repository contains solutions to four tasks in the field of data science and machine learning. Each task addresses a specific problem and utilizes different datasets and techniques. Below, you'll find descriptions of each task along with relevant details.

## Tasks Overview:

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
The task involves building a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The Titanic dataset provides information about individual passengers, including age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

**Check Task1.**

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
In this task, the goal is to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Regression techniques are used to tackle this problem. The dataset consists of historical movie data and associated ratings.

**Check Task2.**

### 3. Iris Flower Classification
The task focuses on classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset contains measurements for three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

**Check Task3.**

### 4. Sales Prediction using Python
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, considering factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. Machine learning techniques in Python are employed to analyze and interpret sales data.

**Check Task4.**
